# PUI 2016 HW 2.


## Working groups

This time I worked bymself due to preferences of working schedules. However,I walked throught the theory if Dictionaries and how to apply it in here to Christian Rosado who belongs to the mornigs. 


## Assigment 1 and 2

The mission of this 2 assigments is locate the buses with the data suministrated by MTA. This data is presented in a form of Json File. After getting the Jason file, the idea is unpacking key by key the dictionary that is the JSON as if Russian Dolls until you get the information that it required. In the Assigment 1 : Bus Line, Number of Vehicles (that  you have a dictoniary of each bus) and the geo location (longitude , latitude) and adding to that the next Stop and the Stop Name located in OnCallWards.

To finish,  script that takes arguments (following Federica's tutorial) wsa created. 
 
## Assigment 3 and Extra Credit

The purpouse is to get a CSV file and work with pandas. The process is alike it was in class , the  only issue was to find the real file nested in other.

I have more issues with the extra credit that either I lost the dates after converting in a number appering in the x-label as numbers and I don´t know how to plot changing dates of 5.000. Or I created a line -that it is what I did ,followig Mohit´s notebooks for UCSL.
