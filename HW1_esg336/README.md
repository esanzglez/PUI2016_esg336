# PUI 2016 HW 1.

## First Part of the Assigment: Finish the Lab.

In this part of the Assigment I finish with a mandatory repository named gittest_esg336. Inside you can find, the first text file called myfirstfile.txt

I did the lab twice just because the first one I ended with a different name of the folder so I started over and I created a new one. I was helped by Vishwajeet Shelar to create the merge conflict. 


## Work on a Fork

I worked on a Fork with 2 different people. First of all, on Friday I fork the repository of Alexey Kalinin(gittest_ak6129) and He forked mine.

Then I worked with Fernando Melchor  (gittest_lmf445). He fork my repository and I forked his although he decided to not pull the changes I created because he was not able to solve the merging problem.

## Setting up an environment

I set up my environment that works and send me to the PUI2016 folder. I did not set up a alias for the ssh .. because I am a user of Windows and I have to use Bitvise.

Here is how I did It:

![alias](https://github.com/esanzglez/PUI2016_esg336/blob/master/HW1_esg336/alias.png "alias")

![second](https://github.com/esanzglez/PUI2016_esg336/blob/master/HW1_esg336/second.png "second")
