#HW3
HW3 is done independently by myself but I did keep up with the conversations on all the errors the classmates discussed in the online chatting groups. And I reviewed two of my old statistics textbooks... I turn to Yao Wang with some questions and he put across some mathmetical terms and deductions and calculations for me, expecially on the Z-test and other tests.
##HW3_Assignment 1
The code in the skeleton notebook does not generate 100 unique random numbers for the total 500 samples, so I used random module instead to do that.

##HW3_Assignment 2
The example code professor gives was very helpful and clear to reproduce and work with. 

##HW3_Assignment 3
The slides professor gives was very helpful and clear. Refer to the HW3_3_hc1924.ipynb
